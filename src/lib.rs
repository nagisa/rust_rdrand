//! An implementation of random number generators based on `rdrand` and `rdseed` instructions.
//!
//! The random number generators provided by this crate are fairly slow (the latency for these
//! instructions is pretty high), but provide high quality random bits. Caveat is: neither AMD’s
//! nor Intel’s designs are public and therefore are not verifiable for lack of backdoors.
//!
//! Unless you know what you are doing, use the random number generators provided by the `rand`
//! crate (such as `OsRng`) instead.
